   Nyan Cat is the name of a YouTube video uploaded in April 2011,
   which became an internet meme. The video merged a Japanese pop song with
   an animated cartoon cat with a Pop-Tart for a torso, flying through space,
   and leaving a rainbow trail behind it. The video ranked at number 5 on
   the list of most viewed YouTube videos in 2011. [#]_
